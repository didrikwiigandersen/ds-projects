## Projects

### [California Housing Price Prediction](./california-housing-prediction/)

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting median house values in California districts using the 1990 California census data. 

**Key Results**: Achieved R² > 0.8 with tuned ensemble models, identifying median income as the strongest predictor of house prices.

### [Building Energy Consumption Prediction](./energy-consumption-prediction/)

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting building energy consumption.

**Key Results**: Achieved high predictive accuracy with tuned ensemble models, identifying relative compactness and surface area as the most important features for energy consumption prediction.
