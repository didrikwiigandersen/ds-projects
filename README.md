## Projects

### [California Housing Price Prediction](./california-housing-prediction/)

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting median house values in California districts using the 1990 California census data. 

**Key Results**: Achieved R² > 0.8 with tuned ensemble models, identifying median income as the strongest predictor of house prices.

### [Building Energy Consumption Prediction](./energy-consumption-prediction/)

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting building energy consumption.

**Key Results**: Achieved high predictive accuracy with tuned ensemble models, identifying relative compactness and surface area as the most important features for energy consumption prediction.

### [Poll Tax Payment Patterns in Roman Egypt](./roman-egypt-poll-tax/)

A statistical analysis of poll tax receipts from Roman Egypt (circa 50 BCE - 250 CE) investigating temporal patterns in tax payment using Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests.

**Key Results**: Found strong evidence that poll tax payments were concentrated in late summer/early fall (July-September), likely corresponding to harvest season, with payment patterns remaining stable across the 300-year period studied.
